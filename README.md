#Escape the Syllabus

Project Synopsis:
Students often disregard reading their syllabus because they believe that it is simply a long, unnecessary document that outlines things that will be covered in class. This leads to many students forgetting about upcoming assignments, test dates, or readings. We want to build an engaging way for students to interface with their syllabus by making it into a video game. Research in the field of “Games and Learning” has indicated that there is a link between a well designed video game and learning tasks that students undergo when playing such a game. Our client, a researcher and professor, with the help of our team would like to test this theory out which serves as our main motivation for coming up with a syllabus game.

Instructions to run:
